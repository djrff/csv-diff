# csv-diff
A simple example for how to find the difference between list values in Python.

This is an intentionally simplified example with a utility module sufficient to work without external libraries in online code editors.

Tested with both [Trinket](https://trinket.io) (based on [Skulpt](https://skulpt.org)) with Python 2.6, and [Repl.it](https://repl.it/) with Python 3.8.
